== Terminology

* Toggle point : swtiching code behaviour
* Toggle router : Determing be behviour of toggle points
* Toggle configuration : Used by toggle router
* Toggle context : Meta data in the request (HTTP..) that might be required by the toggle router (in case of experimentation)

== Toggle Categories

=== Release toggle

- allowing incomplete and untested code to be deployed in production
- Trunk based development
- Transitionary in nature (short lived) / A bigger feature might stay for a period of year

=== Experiment toggle

- used for basic A/B testing
- takes in toggle context
- might live for a higher time till test and control groups gain enough data

=== Ops toggle

- Feature is developed, but realiability is not know (performance implications and other cases (FR/NFR) the system might not be usre of)
- Sample use : is case of performance degrade , switch off the feature (real time)
- Short lived (if realted to performance should be remove when fix confirmed)

=== Permissions toggle

- Champange brunch scnaerios, where feature would be presented to only selected customers
- In case used as premium (premier feature for permium customer) barrier, this feature can stay for the longlest time



=== Further categorization

==== Static vs dynamic

* Static toggles :
** Release / Permission / Ops
** Simple on off switch
* Dynamic toggles :
** Experimentation

==== Long lived Vs Transient

Nothing much to define here Very trasient toggles can be implemented using if/else

== Toggle Implementation Techniques

? layer of indirection

== Toggling in pyspark

=== Release toggle conditions

* Feature under development
* Feature yet to be released

==== Scenarios

* Feature not completly developed
** Airflow work is done in parallel which can use feature toggle to bring a module in workflow
** Airflow work is not done and rest of the feature is under development
*** Impact
**** Airflow is not impacted
**** Pyspark build might be impacted where we introducing code that is not tested
***** Build should not fail
***** In this scenario the feature is created from the scratch

* Feature is developed but enhancements are being made that might not be ready
** Airflow level release toggles is not of help
** Toggle points now needs to be implemented inside the pyspark code
*** Function call to the submodule to be made only if the feature is enabled

== Toggling in UI

* Screens are under development
** Toggle at the page end to show the screen

* Component inside the screen us under development
** Toggle with in the component

== Permission toggle

* Certain modules are not enabled based on client
* Certain submodules are based on client

== Managing Feature Flags

=== Tansparency / Monitoring

* API should be exposed (somewhere in config manager) to see what are the feature flags exposed
* Release notes and feature flags enable diable should match
** Release should also highlight features toggles that have changed
* Deployment process should highglight how to check feature flags

== Toggle management

=== Feature toggle

==== Feature from scratch

* Create feature toggle at the start of a quarter (based on DOR planning and concensus)
* Feature togggle remains false, till a fature is ready to be realease
* As the feature hits the release, dont mark the feature as true , but delete the entry (in a  way that something breaks during UAT)

==== Feature with multi release mode
* These would be features that span multiple quarters or multiple monthly releases

== Feature Config Schema

=== Release features
